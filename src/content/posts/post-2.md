After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

<div class="grid place-items-center h-screen content-center">
  <div class="py-2 px-4 bg-purple-500 text-white font-semibold rounded-lg shadow-md">
    Tailwind classes also work in Markdown!
  </div>
  <a
    href="/"
    class="p-4 underline hover:text-purple-500 transition-colors ease-in-out duration-200"
  >
    Go home
  </a>
</div>
